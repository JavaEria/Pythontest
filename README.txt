1. The Class has been created For Owner, Dog and Cat.
2. I have created csv files for owners, dogs and cats to retrieve the data respectively
and used dataframes (From Pandas Module) to retrieve the values and then storing in a dict file.
3. I have used crud operations in main.py files for Owners and their pets (cats and dogs) as well.
4. The dogs and cats have the foreign id of the owner as it should be unique and the owner can have more than one cat or dog therefore the their ids are saved in the Owner's data as a list.
5. The dict data structure has been used for crud operations
